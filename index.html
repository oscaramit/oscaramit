                  novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
                  The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019,
                  abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, 'CO' stands for 'corona,
                  'VI' for 'virus, and "D' for disease. Formerly, this disease
                  was referred to as "2019 novel coronavirus" or "2019-nov".

                  People in the U. S. may be worried or anxious about friends
                  and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where
                  COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the
                  disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for
                  example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people

                  Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of
                  people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack
                  of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame
                  someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that
                  spreads rumors and myths.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards
                  ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the
                  problem.

                  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause
                  illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline
                  coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                  coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect
                  people and can spread between people. This is suspected to
                  have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East
                  Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                  Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that
                  originated from animals and then spread to people. More

                  This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province,
                  China. The first infections were linked to a live animal
                  market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person.
                  It's important to note that person-to-person spread can happen
                  on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like
                  measles), while other viruses are less so.

                  The virus that causes COVID-19 is

                  Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the
                  illness to others. That is why CDC recommends that these
                  patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                  (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no

                  How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on
                  when to release someone from isolation is made on a
                  case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection
                  prevention and control experts, and public health officials

                  disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of

                  Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                  person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there
                  is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated
                  with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                  always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for
                  general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                  blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the

                  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching
                  a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching
                  their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not

                  In general, because of poor survivability of these
                  coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of
                  spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a

                  Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                  available on the WHO website and through your national and
                  local public health authority. Many countries around the world
                  have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks.
                  Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded
                  in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation

                  with symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person
                  under investigation. Close contacts should monitor their

                  you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to

                  Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms
                  (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have
                  COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you
                  are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are
                  wasting a mask. There is a worldwide shortage of masks, so WHO

                  The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against

                  with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at
                  least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or

                  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                  dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                  congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
                  symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                  become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel
                  unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease
                  without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                  people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
                  difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying
                  medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                  diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People
                  with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                  attention.

                  This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so
                  far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children.
                  Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in
                  adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of
                  COVID-19 that impact your child's school, the school may
                  dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your
                  community. Read or watch local media sources that report
                  school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use
                  alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                <p>
                  If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their
                  child care facility or school. Talk with teachers about
                  classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to
                  keep up with their schoolwork.

                  Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from
                  person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there
                  is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated
                  with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                  always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for
                  general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                  blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the
                  bathroom.

                <p>
                  It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching
                  a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching
                  their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not
                  thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In general, because of poor survivability of these
                  coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of
                  spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a
                  period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen
                  temperatures.

                  How effective are thermal scanners in detecting people

                <p>
                  Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have
                  developed a fever (i. e. have a higher than normal body
                  temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are
                  not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2
                  and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and
                  develop a fever.

                <p>
                  No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine
                  and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine, do not
                  provide protection against the new coronavirus.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The virus is so new and different that it needs its own
                  vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against
                  2019-nov, and WHO is supporting their efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nov,
                  vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly
                  recommended to protect your health.
